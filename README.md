# Bamazon

Bamazon, a node application, is an online store with various products. It uses a mySQL database to store and retrieve product information. 

There is a customer view, in which the user can view and purchase products.

There is also a manager view, in which the user can view all products, view products with low inventory, update inventory, and add new products.


See below to see how the app works and the database before and after the changes were made.
